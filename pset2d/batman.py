# I started by breaking down each component of the program into the following 4 components:
# Na + a + ... + b
# I decided that here a and b could be variables (though technically each of the 4 parts could be one), and specified one less for a since the first Na is separate
a = ' na ' * 15
b = 'BATMAN!'

# Assigned a variable based on the pseudocode that helped me break down each part of the program, then fed it into the for loop below
complete = 'Na ' + a + ' ... ' + b

# for i in range (1):
#     print (complete)
